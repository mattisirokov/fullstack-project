# Integrify fullstack project

This is still a work in progress, I am still adding features and improving the app in my free-time!

## Main features

When starting the project, there were features planned that involving the front-end and back-end, here is a breakdown:

1. Product and user models created

2. Built out the database in MongoBD and created an API.

3. Added filtering and searching functionality to the products

4. CRUD operations for users and products

5. Authentication and log-in system for users via Google implemented (coming soon with better functionality)

6. Mobile responsive (coming soon)
